      Fix GPS build warnings that were promoted to errors.

      CS8632 - Nullable annotation (?) used without nullable context.
               Root fix: Set Nullable to 'annotations' to establish
               a nullable annotations context without enabling full
               nullable flow analysis (which would introduce CS8602 issues).
      CS8981 - Type name contains only lowercase ASCII (e.g. 'glm').
               These names may be reserved by the language in future.
               Demoted to warning; rename to be addressed separately.
      CS0169 - Private field declared but never used.
               These are Visual Studio designer-generated fields for
               UI controls that were removed from the form designer
               but left in the designer .cs file. Demoted to warning.
      CS0414 - Field assigned but its value is never used.
               Demoted to warning; may be used via reflection or
               left from a refactor.
      CS8602 - Dereference of a possibly null reference.
               Demoted to warning; null safety to be addressed
               incrementally once the nullable context is established
               consistently across the codebase.
